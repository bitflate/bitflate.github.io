Technical
----------------

Bitflate is based on Bitcoin. It has the following differences:

- It creates 19.3 million coins in the first halving.
- Proof of Work timespan adjustment is 3.5 days.
- Block time is 2.5 minutes. It has 1-year halving interval.
- In subsequent halvings, coins inflate 7% per year. At this inflation rate, coin supply doubles - every 10 years.

Here's the block reward schedule for the first 10 halvings:

- 0: 50
- 1: 25
- 2: 12.5
- 3: 6.25 (end of halving)
- 4: 6.45 (start of inflation 7%)
- 5: 6.90
- 6: 7.39
- 7: 7.91
- 8: 8.46
- 9: 9.05
- 10: 9.68
