*Bitflate is a cryptocurrency with constant inflation of 7% per year. Its goal is to be a Medium of Exchange.*

First off, one might think how you can compare such a relatively unheard-of small market cap project (as of November 2021) to the feat bitcoin could provide strengthening the USD - let alone given that it's a Bitcoin software fork.

The reasoning is largely derived from psychology and reasoning for businesses and nation-states to adopt bitcoin on a national monetary policy level. Bitcoin has been an anchor for cryptocurrency serving as the most popular store of value. Deemed the 'father' of cryptocurrency it ushered in various approaches to perfecting digital equity and money.

Though we've now reached a point where we're building circular use-cases with each coin. Network & transaction efficiency have shown that it doesn't change the desire to use cryptocurrencies as actual currency. Volatility and desire for an ROI often supersede a coin's intended use-case.

Bitcoin advocates have compelling reasoning for why bitcoin should be pegged to the dollar. It'd take bitcoin out of its investment bubble and likely immensely 'strengthen' the dollar. This would be extremely useful for mitigating inflation if it negated the second-order effects of issuance.
The argument is sensible though there're some very practical reasons for why it wouldn't work as well.

Since bitcoin can be infinitely divisible the assessment that there won't be any to go around decades or centuries down the road isn't valid. What this means is the continuation of uneven distribution is limitless.

Achieving relative fairness for future generations would be impossible. The world isn't fair so while that reasoning alone doesn't substantiate an effective counter-argument it may hint at a future possibility.

Say in 2200, how will society feel about the individuals, families, institutions, and companies that had been fortunate to adopt bitcoin in the early days? Will the disparity in wealth be so great it causes a revolt to the extent of pursuing a 'depegging'?

The next issue, the world operates heavily on debt and credit. When all bitcoins are mined the asset may be purely deflationary. Financial institutions in the U.S. may struggle to issue long-term loans in their country's UoA assuming those who take loans are still earning and making
payments in USD.

While there could be measures taken to avoid this, bitcoin's susceptibility to a hyperbolic growth could inadvertently insight volatility to the USD, perhaps temporarily even causing deflationary periods.

For bitcoin to be pegged to the USD it has to make sense for how the world operates and for the
future.

I believe mixing Bitflate with bitcoin into sidechain hybrid coins can address these issues allow for bitcoin to serve as a lasting solution for strengthening the USD and thus prolonging the dollar's tenure as the global reserve asset.

Bitflate is unique in that it conflates 'inflation' and 'issuance'. While they're commonly misconstrued as the same thing and very much aren't, they're intertwined. Bitflate, with a 7% yearly inflation rate of its supply creates a dynamic where it's susceptible to being utilized as a medium of exchange. This contrasts from bitcoins biggest strength and flaw â€” absolute
scarcity.

By pursuing the path of hybrid coins instead, bitcoin would be more susceptible to undergoing transactions outside the investment markets. Collectively through the years, this could cause a much greater range of distribution that would otherwise happen.

Hybrid coins would be better suited to serve a world so heavily reliant on debt and credit. Financial institutions could have a more viable framework ability to issue loans based on bitcoin.
