Bitflate is a digital native stable coin through a constant 7% annual increase of supply.

While Bitcoin's price appreciation is based on increasing scarcity, we at Bitflate consider an inflationary approach a better fit for a digital currency that claims to be usable for everyday spendings.

You might think "Hold on, a crypto with inflation? Isn't that what keeps my money losing value over time?" And yes, that's true - for one part. However, you have to consider that without financial means like inflation, any currency - be it fiat or digital - tends to fluctuate wildly in value. With a shortage of supply, it's near to impossible to predict its value. While this may be fine for a pure speculation object like gold, it compels 'hoarding' behavior and consequently, no one wants to spend it; making it unlikely to be used as (digital) cash.

Inflation may be a contrary feature to a major premise of other cryptocurrencies regarding their absolute scarcity, but it can also be seen as an economist's tool for creating price control. A 0-7% inflation range can be pursued by mixing Bitflate with bitcoin [Hybrid Coins](https://bitflate.org/post/2020/07/17/hybrid-coins.html). By incorporating inflation from Bitflate with bitcoin-backed services, the added stabilizing effect may result in fair and expectable conditions - which in turn gives way for a greater variety of loan offerings.

That's exactly why we have created Bitflate: A digital native stable coin through inflation.

Bitflate is based on Bitcoin, and will have its code regularly updated with the latest Bitcoin developments.

Technical
----------------

Bitflate is based on Bitcoin. It has the following differences:

- It creates 19.3 million coins in the first three halvings.
- Proof of Work timespan adjustment is 3.5 days.
- Block time is 2.5 minutes. It has 1-year halving interval.
- In subsequent halvings, coins inflate 7% per year. At this inflation rate, coin supply doubles - every 10 years.

Here's the block reward schedule for the first 10 halvings:

- 0: 50
- 1: 25
- 2: 12.5
- 3: 6.25 (end of halving)
- 4: 6.56 (start of inflation 7%)
- 5: 7.02
- 6: 7.51
- 7: 8.04
- 8: 8.60
- 9: 9.20
- 10: 9.85
